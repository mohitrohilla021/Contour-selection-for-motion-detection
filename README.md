# Contour-selection-for-motion-detection

A contour line of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value, so that the curve joins points of equal value.

It is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function f(x, y) parallel to the (x, y)-plane. 

In cartography, a contour line (often just called a "contour") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level.

A contour map is a map illustrated with contour lines, for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and hills, and the steepness or gentleness of slopes.

The contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.
